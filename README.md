# Programming-Fundamentals-C-language

👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Hashir
Welcome to my C Programming Fundamentals repository!
This space showcases my journey through the basics of programming using C language from writing clean code to solving real-world problems with logic and structure.
Crafted with 💻, logic 🧠, and plenty of practice.

This repository contains my coursework, assignments, and projects from the Programming Fundamentals course using the C language. It covers core concepts essential for building a strong foundation in programming, including:

✅ Variables, Data Types, and Operators

🔁 Control Structures (if-else, loops, switch)

🧮 Functions (user-defined and built-in)

🔗 Pointers and Memory Management

📂 File Handling (read/write operations)

📊 Arrays, Strings, and Structures

🔄 Recursion and Iteration

🛒 Mini Projects (e.g., Shopping System, Calculator, etc.

Every line of code here is a result of persistence, not perfection.

**Disclaimer:** Just Stay **CURIOUS** & **CONSISTENT**.🚀
